This is the beginning of a rails app for a personal portfolio project we are doing in [Code Fellows](http://www.codefellows.org). I just added the infancy of blogging functionality at /posts.

The functionality is still quite simple: Enjoy looking at a picture of me on the index, or you can navigate to /posts and CRUD some posts if you so desire.

Note: I have not done any styling on the app so far to save time and we focus on that on a different day.

Here is a screenshot of the index:

And here is one of the posts page:
