[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elliotec/portfolio.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elliotec/portfolio)

This is the beginning of a rails app for a personal portfolio project we are doing in [Code Fellows](http://www.codefellows.org).

The functionality is still quite simple: Enjoy looking at my profile on the index, or you can navigate to /posts and CRUD some posts if you so desire.

The app auto-deploys to Heroku when the build passes with Travis, so I can ensure I don't push bugs to production.

I am going to log screenshots as I progress in the site for my own enjoyment.

Here is a screenshot of the original index:

And here is one of the original posts page:
