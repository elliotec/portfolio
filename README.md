[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elliotec/portfolio.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elliotec/portfolio)

This is the beginning of a rails app for a personal portfolio project we are doing in [Code Fellows](http://www.codefellows.org). I just added the infancy of blogging functionality at /posts.

The functionality is still quite simple: Enjoy looking at a picture of me on the index, or you can navigate to /posts and CRUD some posts if you so desire.

I am going to log screenshots as I progress in the site for my own enjoyment.

Here is a screenshot of the original index:

And here is one of the original posts page:

Here is the root as of 1-16-14:
