This is the beginning of a rails app for a personal portfolio project we are doing in [Code Fellows](http://www.codefellows.org).

The functionality is quite simple: there is nothing you can do but look at the moment.

Enjoy looking at a picture of me.

Note: I did not do any styling to the page for this assignment to save time and we focus on that on a different day.
